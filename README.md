## Quick start


1. To install dependencies and clean the git repo run:

  ```shell
  $ yarn install
  ```

  *We recommend using `yarn` for installing packages, but you can use `npm` instead*:

  ```shell
  $ npm install
  ```
2. Create first build

  ```shell
  $ yarn run build:prod
  ```
3. Copy .env.example file to .env and make the necessary changes there

4. Run project in Dev mode

  ```shell
  $ yarn run dev
  ```

## Features

* Redux
* Modern ES6 for using template strings, JSX syntax, object destructuring arrow functions and more
* Babel for old browser support
* React Router
* Hot Module Replacement for comfortable development
* MongoDB/ Mongoose
* Socket.IO ( by half :) )


## Command Line Commands

#### Installation

```Shell
yarn install
```
Installs the dependencies.

#### Development

```Shell
yarn run dev
```

Starts the development server running on `http://localhost:8080` using the webpack.development.config.js with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) (Changes in the application code will be hot-reloaded)

```Shell
yarn run dev:server
```

Starts the development server and makes your application accessible at http://localhost:8080.

```Shell
yarn run clean
```
Removes a directory "dist" from a project

#### Building

```Shell
yarn build:prod
```

Prepares your app for deployment to production environment (using the webpack.production.frontend.config.js) (does not run tests). Optimizes and minifies all files, piping them to the `dist` folder.


#### Testing

```Shell
yarn run test
```

Tests your application modern JavaScript Testing Framework - Jest with the unit tests specified in the `**/__tests__/*.spec.js` files
throughout the application.

```Shell
yarn run test:watch
```

Watches changes to your application and re-runs tests whenever a file changes.

```Shell
yarn run coverage
```

Generates test coverage.


It’s also possible to leave out the run in this command, each script can be executed with its name, e.g:
yarn test:watch
yarn test:coverage

#### Linting

```Shell
yarn run lint
```
Will analyse your code for potential errors. Will check both: `./client/**/**.js` and `./server/**/**.js` files.
Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn’t adhere to certain style guidelines.


```Shell
yarn run lint:server
```

Will analyse only  `server/**/**.js` files

#### Docker
Nginx web server working on 443, 80 ports on localhost

```run production
docker-compose -f .\docker\PROD.docker-compose.yml up (Options: --build for build, -d to detach )
docker-compose -f .\docker\PROD.docker-compose.yml down (To stop contaiters)
```
```run develop
docker-compose -f .\docker\DEV.docker-compose.yml up (Options: --build for build, -d to detach )
docker-compose -f .\docker\DEV.docker-compose.yml down (To stop contaiters)
```
